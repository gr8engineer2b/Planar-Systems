# Planar-Systems
D&D World Creation Tool


For facilitating the creation of richer long form campaigns


V1.0.0 Run the Setup file (Windows only at the moment)

place test.txt and/or test2.txt in AppData/Roaming/planar-systems/

it will read from those and try to convert it from a JSON string to a display in the app

only supported format at the moment is as follows:

{
  "type": "character",
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "Name",
      "profession": "Namer"
    }
  ]
}
